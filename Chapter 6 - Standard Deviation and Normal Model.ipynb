    "* if we model the data with a Normal model, and standardize the values using the corresponding $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, we call the standardized values z-scores as before:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Cautions\n",
    "\n",
    "* when we use the Normal model, we assume that the distribution of the data is Normal\n",
    "* it's sufficient to check the following condition:  the shape of the data's distribution is unimodal and symmetric\n",
    "* check this by making a histogram or a Normal probability plot\n",
    "* all models make **assuptions** - be sure to call out those assumptions as part of the analysis and check the associated **conditions** in the data"
