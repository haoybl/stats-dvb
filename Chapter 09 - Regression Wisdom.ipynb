    "* prediction for x values outside the original domain of predictor variables is known as **extrapolation**\n",
    "* they require the (questionable) assumption that nothing about the relationship between $x$ and $y$ changes even at extreme values of $x$ and beyond.\n",

    "  * a data value can have a large residual; these always deserve special attention\n",
    "  * a data value can have an x-value that is far from the mean of the x-values; such a point is said to have high **leverage**\n",
    "* a point with leverage that is not in-line with the majority of other points has a tendency to pull the regression line towards itself\n",
    "* a point with leverage that _is_ in-line with the majority of other points tends to over-inflate the correlation and $R^2$ values\n",
    "* a point is said to be **influential** if omitting it from the analysis gives a very different model (i.e. changes the slope)\n",
    "\n",
    "* to determine if a point is influential, fit the linear model both with and without the point, and check for differences\n",
    "\n",
    "* warning: influential points can be difficult to spot in plots of residuals; they're often easier to see in scatterplots of the original data"
